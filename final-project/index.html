    <p>Elahe Mohammadi wanted to write about the funeral for a young woman who died in police custody and to interview the mourning family. The family was planning the funeral of a victim of police brutality, but as soon as Mohammadi arrived, Iranian authorities arrested her.</p>
    <p>After her arrest on Sept. 29, 2022, Iranian authorities broke into her house. They seized her personal belongings and later sentenced her to 12 years in prison for spreading “false information,” “propaganda,” and “insulting the leader.” The charges were based on her investigative journalism about protests.</p>

    <p>Mohammadi, 36, was charged with acting against Iran’s national security and disturbing public order. She had been covering the protests and arrests in the aftermath of Mahsa Amini’s death. The Iranian authorities were keen on stopping journalists from documenting the unrest that shook the nation.</p>

    <p>On Jan. 14, Mohammadi was granted temporary release on bail after a global outcry. Despite the difficult conditions, she continued to report, even under the threat of imprisonment.</p>
