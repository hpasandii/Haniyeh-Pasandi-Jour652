        Elahe Mohammadi wanted to write about the funeral for a young woman who died in police custody 
        and to interview the mourning family as they buried their loved one. Instead, the newspaper reporter 
        for Ham Mihan in Tehran was arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international 
        press advocacy organization.

        After her arrest on Sept. 29, 2022, Iranian authorities broke into her house, searched it for two hours 
        and confiscated her laptop, books, phone and press card, her lawyer Mohammad-Ali Kamfirouzi explained 
        in a tweet posted on X, previously known as Twitter.

        Mohammadi, 36, was charged with acting against Iran’s national security and for making propaganda against 
        the government. She has been in prison for over a year. On Oct. 22 Mohammadi was sentenced to 12 years in 
        prison, six for allegedly collaborating with the U.S. government, five for acting against national security 
        and one for “propaganda against the Islamic government.”

        On Jan. 14, Mohammadi was granted temporary release on bail from Evin Prison, according to the United States 
        Commission on International Religious Freedom.

        Mohammadi had traveled to the city of Saqqez in the north-western Kurdish part of Iran to cover the funeral 
        of the 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of the morality police on Sept. 16, three days after 
        they detained her for not wearing her hijab correctly, according to numerous news reports at the time.

      <p>
        Iranian authorities later said that an investigation found she had died of “multiple organ failure caused by 
        cerebral hypoxia, or lack of oxygen to the brain” which it attributed to “underlying diseases.”
