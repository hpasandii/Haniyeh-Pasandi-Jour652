    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>Elahe Mohammadi wanted to write about the funeral for a young woman who died in police custody and to interview the mourning family as they buried their loved one. Instead, the newspaper reporter for Ham Mihan in Tehran was arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international press advocacy organization.</p>

      “Journalism in Iran is really an act of courage,” Jasmin Ramsey, the Deputy Director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran in New York City, told Capital News Service in an interview.

    <p>Mohammadi had traveled to the city of Saqqez in the north-western Kurdish part of Iran to cover the funeral of the 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of the morality police on Sept. 16, three days after they detained her for not wearing her hijab correctly, according to numerous news reports at the time.</p>
