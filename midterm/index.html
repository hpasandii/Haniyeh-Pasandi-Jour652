    <h1>Marylanders Brace for Natural Gas Export Facility</h1>

        <h2>Cove Point: The Transition from Imports to Exports</h2>
        <p>
          The natural gas pipes on Dominion’s Cove Point property in Lusby, Md., have been chilled to around negative 260 degrees Fahrenheit.
          That’s because the natural gas that will eventually flow through them will need to be in liquid form, super-cooled, in order to travel from tankers to the shore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cove Point will export its first tankers of liquefied natural gas — liquefied because it needs to be transported across the ocean from the U.S. to Japan, India and Spain.
          A wave of these ships is expected to come out of Maryland’s sole natural gas export facility in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cove Point, owned by the Virginia-based Dominion Resources, is one of the only natural gas export facilities in the U.S. It’s also a big part of the regional and national economy and natural gas future, say supporters, while opponents point to environmental concerns.

        <h2>From the Eastern Shore to the Western Mountains</h2>
        <p>
          Paul Roberts, who owns Deep Creek Cellars, a winery in Garrett County, in the mountainous, westernmost corner of Maryland, has long been concerned about Dominion’s role in exporting natural gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has been following the issue closely for years. He’s organized opposition to fracking — a controversial method of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations — in Garrett County.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Cove Point, more than 200 miles from the shale in western Maryland, is still close to his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re now seeing liquefied natural gas being exported at Cove Point,” Roberts said. “And the real question is, at what price, at what risk, and who benefits?”

        <h2>The Economics of Natural Gas</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to environmental concerns surrounding the plant, Cove Point also has major economic implications for Maryland, say advocates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supporters say the facility has created hundreds of jobs in Calvert County and will provide a long-term economic boost to the region. Dominion said the facility will bring in an estimated $40 million in annual tax revenue to the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The export facility will also have a major impact on the global natural gas market, according to analysts.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is about liquefied natural gas, and we know from the statistics that the demand for LNG is going to be growing internationally,” said David Buch, an energy analyst with Dominion Resources.
